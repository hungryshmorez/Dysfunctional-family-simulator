A lightweight, open-source Sims-like house builder built entirely in the browser using Three.js.

This repository provides a polished, grid-based architecture and interior design system featuring wall patterns, floor styles, modular stairs, and dynamic UI panels.

Built with Next.js 15, React 18, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS. No backend, no authentication — everything runs client-side.

**[Live Demo](https://ch-bas.github.io/threejs-sims-house-builder/)**

```

## Feature tour

### Building

- **68 furniture items** across 12 categories (Seating, Tables, Bedroom,
  Storage, Kitchen, Bathroom, Electronics, Security, Decor, Outdoor,
  People, Structure).
- **Multi-floor buildings** up to 4 levels — ground floor + up to three
  upper floors, with a FloorSwitcher to select, add, remove, rename
  (double-click), reorder, and **clone** the active floor. Each floor
  has its own items and finishes; per-floor stats break down cost and
  count in the sidebar.
- **Stairs** as a furniture type that visually bridges one floor to the
  next (14 steps, stringers, slanted handrails).
- **Roof** on top of the highest floor: Flat, Gable, or Hipped, with a
  per-roof colour picker.
- **Categorised catalog** with search, filter chips, and price tags ($).
- **Security cameras with vision cones**: wall-mounted CCTV that mimics
  real-world camera models (`lib/cctv-models`), flush or bracket
  mounting, and a Desperados-style directional vision cone with
  configurable range and FOV — rendered as a coverage overlay alongside
  Wi-Fi signal rings. The cone **detects objects**: furniture or NPCs
  inside the field of view flip it from cyan to alert red, the wedge
  pulses faster, and the sweeping scan line flares as it passes over the
  target. The overlay renders depth-test-free so walls and furniture
  never occlude it.
- **Drag-from-catalog placement**: drag an item directly onto the 3D
  viewport to drop it where you release. Items **auto-lock** on placement
  and re-lock after every drag, so finished furniture can't be nudged by
  accident; unlock from the item editor to reposition.
- **Outdoor items stay outdoors**: trees, fences, pools, BBQs, and other
  garden items flag a collision when any part of their footprint pokes
  into the building, and catalog drops default to just outside the south
  wall.
- **3D mesh builders** for every type — beds, sofas (standard/L/U-shape),
  fridges, stoves, sinks, toilets, bathtubs, showers, trees, fences,
  pools, stairs, people / pets for scale, and more.
- **7 room templates**: Bedroom, Living Room, Home Office, Kitchen,
  Bathroom, Studio Apartment, plus a populated multi-floor **Two-Story Home**.
- **5 theme presets** (Modern, Rustic, Minimalist, Cozy, Tropical) that
  recolour walls, floor, and furniture by category across every floor.
- **5 furniture sets** that drop a curated combo (Dining, Bedroom,
  Home Office, Kitchen Line, Lounge) at the current cursor.

### Editing

- **Drag** in 3D to reposition; arrow keys fine-tune (Shift = 1 m).
- **Multi-select** with Ctrl/⌘+click — bulk delete, **group-drag** (move
  the whole selection by the same delta), **group rotate** (R / Shift+R
  rotates every selected item), plus **Align**
  (left/centre/right/top/centre/bottom) and **Distribute** (X/Z) for 3+
  items.
- **Per-item editor**: dimension sliders, **precise X/Z numeric inputs**,
  rotation in degrees, mirror, lock, "Centre in room" shortcut, colour
  picker (with a persisted "Recent" strip) + 🎲 randomise.
- **Bulk lock / unlock all** on the active floor.
- **Collision visibility**: colliding items get a red row + ⚠️ badge in
  the placed-items list, and a counter shows up in stats.
- **Snap-to-grid**, **snap-to-wall**, and **snap-to-items** toggles —
  stackable, rotation-aware.
- **Auto-organize** with three strategies: packed, by category, by size.
- **Surprise me** picks a room-appropriate furniture set + random decor.
- **Undo / redo** (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z) — snapshot-based, debounced,
  50-entry stack.

### Walls, floor & roof

- **Per-wall colours** (N/S/E/W) plus per-floor floor colour.
- **Floor patterns**: Solid, Wood Planks, Tile, Carpet, Concrete.
- **Wall patterns**: Solid, Brick, Wallpaper, Wood Panel, Plaster, Siding.
- All patterns are rendered procedurally to CanvasTextures — no asset
  files.
- **Floor plan image** upload (per building) with opacity, fit-mode
  (stretch/cover/contain), and optional 3D displacement.
- **Roof** picker (None / Flat / Gable / Hipped) with a colour.
- **Doors and windows** that cut openings in the nearest wall when
  dropped — both exterior and interior walls support the cutouts.
- **Interior walls**: a chained draw-mode (click successive floor points
  to lay a polyline of thin wall segments) with **vertex snapping**
  (existing endpoints), **right-angle snapping** (perpendicular to the
  previous segment), and a live preview of the next segment. Doors and
  windows near an interior wall cut through it via ExtrudeGeometry with
  holes.
- **Click-to-select walls** in any mode: clicking a wall in 3D outlines
  it and auto-opens the Paint panel targeting it — exterior walls paint
  per-side, and a selected interior wall takes the colour itself. **Delete** removes a
  selected interior wall permanently, or toggles an exterior wall hidden
  (open side). The panel's **Wall Visibility** row (N/E/S/W) shows hidden
  walls crossed out and restores them with a click; hidden walls persist
  per floor.

### View

- **3D / 2D top-down** toggle.
- **Walkthrough mode**: first-person WASD camera at the active floor's
  eye height (PointerLockControls + Shift sprint).
- **Camera presets**: Iso, Top-down, Front, Corner, plus **Fit-to-room**.
- **Show all floors** toggle stacks every level at once with ghosted
  lower floors.
- **Sun-arc time-of-day** (continuous 0–24) drives ambient and sun
  colour, intensity, and position. Lamps light up at night. Dawn / Noon /
  Dusk / Midnight presets plus a ▶ button advances time in real-time.
- **Gradient sky** — a vertical zenith-to-horizon gradient backdrop that
  follows the time of day: deep blue over pale at noon, lavender over
  warm orange at dawn/dusk, near-black over navy at night.
- **Outdoor garden mode**: grass, stone path ring, scattered bushes.
- **Top-down minimap** overlay (active floor).
- **Hover tooltips** showing item icon, name, price ($), and dimensions.
- **3D measurement tool**: pick two floor points to see the distance.
- **Catalog search highlights matching placed items** with an amber
  outline in the active floor.
- **Floating item labels** sprite above each piece in 3D when enabled.
- **Cost-density heatmap** in the 2D view, with a min/max gradient legend.
- **Walking NPCs** that wander the active floor between random waypoints
  (procedural human meshes, leg-bob animation, RAF-driven motion).
- **Collapsible sidebar** for full-viewport editing.
- **Walkthrough HUD** with a centre reticle + WASD/Sprint/Esc help banner.
- **Multi-select badge** floating at the top of the viewport when more
  than one item is selected.
- **Optional Web-Audio sound cues** for placement, removal, rotation,
  and achievement unlocks.

### UI / chrome

- **Floating glass panels** overlaid on the viewport: `BuildToolsPanel`
  (bottom-left, category picker + wall-draw + 2D/walkthrough toggles),
  `CatalogStrip` (bottom-centre, drag-source tile row), `ModePanel`
  (bottom-right, LIVE / BUILD / BUY mode and stats).
- **Sidebar tabs** for the optional expanded sidebar: **Build / Buy /
  Style / Manage**. Sidebar is **collapsed by default** for full-viewport
  editing; toggled from the header's "◀ Show panels" button.
- **Floating item-context popover** appears next to the selected piece
  with dimension/colour/rotation controls, replacing a fixed sidebar panel.
- **Themed dark-slate header** with chip-strip stats (items, floors, room
  dimensions, cost vs budget).

### Project management

- **Auto-save** to `localStorage` (1.5s debounce). Legacy single-floor
  saves continue to load thanks to the schema migration.
- **Saved-layouts library**: name, save, list, load, delete; entry stores
  item and floor counts.
- **Export / import layout** as JSON (with structural validation).
- **Inventory CSV** with a Floor column.
- **PNG screenshot** of the current viewport.
- **GLB / glTF export** of the live Three.js scene — opens in any viewer.
- **Shareable URLs**: the layout is base64-url encoded into the hash; the
  app hydrates from it if present on load. Floor-plan images are stripped
  to keep URLs compact.

### Game-y

- **15 achievements** ("First Steps", "Furnished", "Overstuffed",
  "Big Spender", "WiFi Everywhere", "Sky High", "Penthouse", "Going Up",
  "Roof It", "Green Thumb", "Door Installer", "Window Watcher",
  "Wall Whisperer", "Decorator", "Open Plan") with toast pop-ups when
  unlocked and a sidebar gallery panel showing locked / unlocked progress.

### Stats

- **Header chip strip**: items / floors / room dimensions / cost-vs-budget.
- **Statistics panel**: items, floors, floor area, total area, footprint
  coverage %, cost vs. budget, breakdown by category.

### Welcome

- **First-run welcome banner** with quick-start tips.

## Design notes

- **Building, not room.** `RoomLayout` owns `floors[]`, `roof?`, and the
  building footprint; `FloorLayout` owns items, floor colour, and per-wall
  colours. All item-scoped operations implicitly target the active floor
  via the reducer's `withActiveFloor` helper.
- **Snapshot-based undo/redo** works at the layout level, so floor adds,
  alignments, theme application, and individual moves are all reversible
  without bespoke code per action.
- **Schema migrations** are non-destructive. `parseStoredLayout` accepts
  both the current multi-floor shape and the legacy single-floor shape,
  upgrading the latter into a one-floor building. Used everywhere
  external data crosses the boundary (localStorage hydrate, JSON import,
  library load, share URL decode). A stored blob that exists but fails to
  load is copied to a `-recovery` localStorage key before the fallback
  layout's autosave can overwrite it, so validation failures never
  destroy a save.
- **Three.js init / teardown is encapsulated.** `useThreeScene` owns the
  renderer, camera, controls, animation loop, resize listener, drag,
  hover, and the parameterised drag-plane Y. It always returns a
  cleanup and cancels the RAF. PNG capture renders a fresh frame
  synchronously before reading the canvas, so `preserveDrawingBuffer`
  stays off and the renderer keeps its buffer optimisations. Scene rebuilds live in `useSceneEffects`.
- **Filmic rendering pipeline.** ACES tone mapping, explicit sRGB output,
  device-pixel-ratio-aware rendering (capped at 2×), PCF soft shadows, and
  image-based lighting from a PMREM-filtered `RoomEnvironment`. The
  environment intensity is driven by the time-of-day system so nights stay
  dark, and procedural CanvasTextures get max anisotropy + sRGB tagging so
  floors and walls don't shimmer at grazing angles in walkthrough mode.
- **Render-on-demand.** The animation loop only renders when OrbitControls
  report movement or something marks the scene dirty (`invalidate()` is
  threaded through the scene-effect, walkthrough, NPC, and camera-preset
  hooks). During walkthrough the loop skips `OrbitControls.update()`
  entirely — the update has no `enabled` guard and would fight the
  pointer-lock camera — and the walkthrough hook invalidates its own
  frames. An idle editor draws zero frames. The shadow map (`autoUpdate`
  off) and the NPC loop only refresh when a caster actually moves, and the
  WebGL context is restored automatically if the GPU drops it.
- **Instanced outdoor scenery.** The suburban lot's high-count scatter
  (grass tufts, shrubs, flowers, road dashes, stepping stones) renders
  through `InstancedMesh` — hundreds of elements collapse to a handful of
  draw calls — and static meshes bake their matrix once (`matrixAutoUpdate`
  off).
- **Drag fast-path.** While dragging, meshes are moved directly and the
  single state dispatch is deferred to drag end — no per-mousemove scene
  rebuild. Collision feedback stays live via an emissive tint on the dragged
  group, and each drag gesture lands as one undo entry.
- **OBB collision.** Item overlap uses a separating-axis test on rotated
  footprints, with the old bounding-circle check kept as a broad phase — no
  more false positives on long thin items placed diagonally. The pair test
  is layer-aware: wall-plane items (doors/windows/cameras) collide only
  with each other, low-profile items (rugs) go under furniture, and
  type-based stacking families cover tabletop-items-on-surfaces and
  seats-under-tables.
- **Context over props.** `RoomEditorContext` and `SelectionContext`
  distribute state to panels — ~90 drilled props eliminated. Props are
  reserved for one-off callbacks with side effects (scene-ref closures,
  selection clearing).
- **Pure helpers** wherever possible. Snap-to-wall, snap-to-neighbours,
  collisions, bounds, alignment, distribution, achievements predicates,
  theme application, and share-URL codec are all React-free pure
  functions — easy to test, easy to reason about.

## Original bug fixes still in effect

1. Auto-save actually wires live state into `localStorage` (debounced).
2. `requestAnimationFrame` is cancelled on unmount — no orphan loop.
3. `snapToGrid` no longer tears down the scene on toggle.
4. Init effect always returns a cleanup, even on partial failure.
5. Canvas snapshotted at the top of the init effect.
6. No `window.THREE` / `window.OrbitControls` globals.
7. `importLayout` structurally validates JSON before applying it.
8. Floor-plan fit-mode select is exposed in the UI.
9. `URL.revokeObjectURL` after JSON / GLB / PNG / CSV download.
10. Every scene-removal path disposes GPU resources (geometries,
    materials, textures, light shadow maps) via a shared
    `disposeObject` helper — scene rebuilds no longer leak GPU memory.

## Known limitations

- A large floor-plan image stored as base64 can exhaust the ~5 MB
  `localStorage` quota; the save call catches and warns instead of crashing.
- Walkthrough requires a click on the canvas to engage pointer lock.
- The UI is responsive down to phone sizes — the HUD reflows, the item
  editor becomes a bottom sheet, the sidebar goes full-screen, and short /
  landscape viewports compact the floating chrome — but it isn't a
  mobile-first redesign; very small screens stay dense.
- No "rooms from enclosed walls" detection — interior walls are just
  drawn segments, not space-bounding entities.
